- 👋 Hi, I’m @archmagos-dominus
- 👀 I’m interested in automatization, AI research and little hardware projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how not to lose my mind when coding in Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that serves to decentralize the tech industry
- 📫 How to reach me: shout really loud.

But seriously, you can [e-mail me here](mailto:degmnpj9c@mozmail.com).
You can also check my [showcasing website](https://archmagos-dominus.github.io/) if you're in the mood.
For AI models and datasets that I maintain you can visit my [huggingface repositories](https://huggingface.co/archmagos).
If you want to test the bots out you can join my Discord [dev/demo server](https://discord.gg/xsBSmfVvkM) (contains both HourAI/ShanghAI, Mima bot and any other bot I am currently trying not to lose my sanity over).
